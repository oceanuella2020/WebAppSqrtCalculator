# WebAppSqrtCalculator
This Repository Consist of a  folder on C# task 4 which is a Web app square root calculator. 
It is a Web Application that can accept Two numbers and display which has a higher square root to the user. 
If the numbers have the same square root, the system will inform the user and ask them to enter another value. 
If the value entered is not a number, you will be notified to insert only numbers.
It accepts only positive whole numbers.
Still Learning to make it better soon.
